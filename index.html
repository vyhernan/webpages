    <h2>Welcome to Victor's Website!</h2>
   
    <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
    <p> <strong>Hello!</strong> My name is <em>Victor Hernandez</em> and I am currently
    majoring in <ins>Civil Engineering</ins> at NC State. I chose this major because I
    have a background in working in construction with my dad and since day one I have
    always wanted to know how it is to run big construction projects and with degree I 
    would be able to reach the goals I have set on myself.
    </p>    
    <br />
    <!-- Paragraph 2-->
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 17px; text-align: center; color: #CC0000;">
I am currently working at QuikTrip and usually work every weekend after finishing classes
and work for the week. I am a clerk at QuikTrip and my day-to-day at work is to follow the 
core value that our company holds and making sure that the customers are being satisfied.
My current job has given me many skills in customer service that could help me in my future
job as a Project Manager to help and satisfy future clients.
